1. Making a table including the top hit for each transcript - six_AA: the group did a
good job creating this code since it produces a table including only the name of the 
nucleotides, instead of the entire lines 

2. "Use bash script to loop over the 6 transcript files and 4 "RNAseq files," executing 
these commands" - your helioser.sh file does not include the code you used for the first 
two parts of this step - using muscle and hmmbuild.
